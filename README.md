# ReplyCorp

**ReplyCorp** is a social-commerce infrastructure platform that turns
engagement into programmable economics.

Instead of treating social activity as passive metrics, ReplyCorp
enables posts, creators, and communities to function as live economic
systems - where attribution, incentives, and payouts can be automated
and verified.

ReplyCorp connects Web2 social behavior with Web3 financial logic,
allowing brands, creators, and agentic systems to coordinate value flow
in real time.

## What ReplyCorp Does

ReplyCorp transforms social interaction into measurable, programmable
outcomes.

With ReplyCorp, you can:

-   Launch engagement-driven campaigns
-   Track attribution across replies, reposts, and quotes
-   Route commissions automatically through smart contracts
-   Build incentive systems around content
-   Enable AI agents or communities to operate campaigns autonomously

The goal is simple:

**Turn attention into infrastructure.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why ReplyCorp Exists

Social platforms generate massive economic value, but most of it is
invisible or manually coordinated.

ReplyCorp introduces a programmable layer where:

-   Engagement becomes a financial signal
-   Campaign logic runs automatically
-   Payouts happen transparently onchain
-   Creators and partners participate in shared incentives

This allows marketing, growth, and community coordination to function
more like software than traditional advertising.

## Platform Philosophy

ReplyCorp is built around a few core principles:

-   **Composable** - Works alongside existing social platforms
-   **Chain-agnostic** - Supports multiple blockchain environments
-   **Agent-ready** - Designed for autonomous workflows
-   **Event-driven** - Real-time ingestion and processing
-   **Transparent** - Onchain routing where it matters

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## High-Level Architecture

ReplyCorp consists of several coordinated layers:

-   **Ingestion Layer** - Collects engagement events
-   **Processing Layer** - Normalizes and scores activity
-   **Campaign Engine** - Applies attribution logic
-   **Fee Router Contracts** - Executes payouts
-   **API & Dashboard** - Interfaces for partners and developers

The system is evolving toward a distributed microservices model to
support large-scale campaigns and automated agents.
